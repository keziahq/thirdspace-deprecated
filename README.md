## Build a community that grows your business through customer advocacy

How does your growth strategy harness the potential of community to engage your current users, and attract more like-minded customers?

## What is a Third Space?
Third spaces are designed environments that facilitate value-creating human connection. From a hackathon, to a facebook group, or even your favourite bar where you meet new friends, third spaces are where community is nurtured and thrives. Third spaces create growth for the organisation that facilitates them, and for the people who meet there.

## Why is a Community-led growth approach an important strategy?
Also known as _community craft_, an experienced community professional builds, nurtures and measures your customer engagement, retention, loyalty and advocacy to help you achieve the business growth and ROI you want.

*Unlock Customer Advocacy: Community is an underused, underestimated way to empower your best customers to get and give value to each other, extending the sales cycle beyond conversion, and into advocacy. 

*Strengthen Brand Identity & Experience: The community you facilitate for your users is based on the brand identity that attracted your customers in the first place. 

*Attract more like-minded customers: When your customers find value in the brand experience beyond your product: shared identity, a sense of belonging and being able to contribute, the network effect attracts more like-minded customers to your business.

## This doesn't sound new
Indeed, the business benefits of community craft have been the driving force of growth for Reddit, Fan Clubs (online and offline), Bars, Hobby Groups and forums like ![Lenovo's Peer to Peer Community](https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/English-Community/ct-p/Community-EN).

But what is exciting is how we can harness these strategies for everyday businesses, in a way that allows users to go beyond what employees in sales, customer service, business development and even social media managers can do in a workday.
